// X402CoinbaseAdapter — FacetPaymentRailAdapter implementation for x402
// USDC settlement on Base via the Coinbase facilitator.
//
// Delegates verification and settlement to the official `x402` SDK
// (verify + settle from `x402/verify`) routed through `@coinbase/x402`'s
// preconfigured facilitator. We do NOT reimplement EIP-3009 verification,
// nonce dedup, or facilitator HTTP — the SDK handles all of that and
// will continue to handle protocol revisions without us tracking the
// wire format manually.
//
// This adapter handles ALL agents that settle over x402 — agents
// provisioned by AWS Bedrock AgentCore Payments AND agents provisioned
// by Coinbase AgentKit AND any other platform that produces a valid
// x402 PaymentPayload. The agent-side platform difference is at the
// attestation layer, handled by a separate FacetOriginationVerifier.
