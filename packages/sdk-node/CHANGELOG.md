## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- **`fetchAgentsTxt` storefront discovery-pointer fallback + `Facet-Version:
1.2` support.** On a `404` at `/.well-known/agents.txt`, discovery now falls
  back to a storefront pointer: an HTTP `Link: <url>; rel="agents"` header, a
  `<link rel="agents" href>`, or a `<meta name="agents-txt" content>` in the
  host's HTML (absolute-https only, one hop), and fetches the manifest it names
  (spec section 7). This lets agents discover a Terminal on platforms that reserve
  `/.well-known/` (e.g. Shopify storefronts). Also adds `1.2` to
  `SUPPORTED_FACET_VERSIONS`: it's the version the live Terminal emits, and its
  absence made `discoverAndConnect` throw `UnsupportedVersionError` against every
  real merchant.
- **Typed wire surface generated from
  `openapi/openapi.yaml`.** New exports:
  - `createTerminalClient(opts)`: builds an `openapi-fetch` client
    typed against the canonical spec. `.GET("/v1/health")` etc. return
    `{ data, error, response }` with discriminated-union narrowing for
    routes whose request body uses `oneOf + discriminator` (e.g.
    `POST /v1/payments/dispatch`).
  - Type-only re-exports: `paths`, `components`, `operations`,
    `CreateTerminalClientOptions`, `TypedTerminalClient`.
- New dev script `scripts/regenerate.sh` that re-emits
  `src/generated/schema.d.ts` from the spec. Idempotent, running
  twice produces no diff unless the spec changed. Wired into the
  top-level `scripts/regenerate-sdks.sh` orchestrator.
- Smoke test suite (`test/smoke.test.ts`) that drives the typed client
  against a live Facet Terminal, gated to the `sdk-smoke-test` CI
  tier via a separate `vitest.smoke.config.ts`. Override the target
  with `FACET_SMOKE_BASE_URL`.
- Regenerated `src/generated/schema.d.ts` from the current OpenAPI spec,
  adding typed coverage for new route families: UCP checkout-sessions,
  per-line Boson escrow, MPP charge, refund/resolve, deferred-redeem relay,
  owner-scoped get_signatures, and the public `/v1/stores` directory.

### Changed

- **Public API unchanged.** `discoverAndConnect`, `fetchAgentsTxt`,
  `TerminalClient` (the `FacetClient` re-alias), and the typed error
  classes (`NoManifestError`, `InvalidManifestError`,
  `UnsupportedVersionError`, `FetchError`, `CapabilityMismatchError`,
  `SUPPORTED_FACET_VERSIONS`) are all retained with identical shape
  and behavior.
- The hand-written ergonomic helpers stay the recommended entry point;
  the new typed client is exposed for callers that want a thin
  per-route handle without wrapper allocation overhead.

### Dependencies

- Added `openapi-fetch@0.17.0` (runtime, exact-pinned).
- Added `openapi-typescript@7.13.0` (dev, exact-pinned).
- Both pins satisfy the supply-chain guardrail
  (`scripts/check-pinned-deps.sh`).
